Toderp
===========

Toderp is a new way to manage your daily tasks and todos.

Instead of putting everything into one big list and marking it off as it's completed, Toderp lets you bite off only the most important tasks for each day, and manage them in a timeline-based fashion.

Confused? Me too. With ToDerp, you only work on the most important tasks for today (I recommend no more than 5 big things a day), and you either finish them that day, or they go back to the Toderp backlog.
